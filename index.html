<h3 style="color: #ffff00;">How it works</h3>
<p>You are given a cross section down the middle of an F1 car's chassis. Using pretty much any 2D design software, design the rear/front wings, bodywork and the floor to fit.
Once that's designed, you send it to me for testing. I will find the coeffecient of lift and drag, and convert them into performance charachteristics in Ultimate Racing
2D 2. From there I will race the cars on the saturday of each real life Grand Prix weekend, posting the results and video to match alongside.
<br>
As another dimension to this game/challenge, drivers will be able to be traded between teams.
