<h1>THE 2D-CHALLENGE</h1>
<img src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fproject38r.carrd.co%2Fassets%2Fimages%2Fimage02.jpg%3Fv%3D6af8e9ef&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=357b852209efffaac529cf1ba05640eab47a62347024e7139c38002dc8e511c1&ipo=images">

<h3 style="color: #ffff00;">How it works</h3>
<p>You are given a cross section down the middle of an F1 car's chassis. Using pretty much any 2D design software, design the rear/front wings, bodywork and the floor to fit.
Once that's designed, you send it to me for testing. I will find the coeffecient of lift and drag, and convert them into performance charachteristics in Ultimate Racing
2D 2. From there I will race the cars on the saturday of each real life Grand Prix weekend, posting the results and video to match alongside.
<br><br>
As another dimension to this game/challenge, drivers will be able to be traded between teams.
</p>
